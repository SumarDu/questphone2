**QuestPhone** is an open-source Android productivity utility designed to help users reduce screen addiction by regulating app usage through a gamified experience. The application blocks distracting apps and unlocks them only once the user completes all their work.

It was started in April 2024 under the name *DigipawFull* and is now continued as *QuestPhone*.
